PYTHON PROGRAMMING 101: AGE CLASSIFIER

This program defines a function called classify_age that categorizes a person based on their age. It checks if the input age is negative and prints an error message if it is; otherwise, it classifies the person as a Child, Teen, Adult, or Senior based on their age. The function is designed to work with a variety of test cases, including negative numbers, to help students understand function definitions and conditional statements in Python.
